# ZK-based Database for AI

This project demonstrates a ZK-based database designed specifically for AI applications using Rust and the `bellman` library for zk-SNARKs.

## Overview

The ZK-based database provides significant benefits over traditional databases for AI applications by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and security. This example showcases a basic ZK circuit to represent a simple database query, generate a proof, and verify it. It's important to note that this example is for educational purposes only and does not provide a complete, practical ZK-based database system.

## Benefits

- **Privacy**: The ZK-based database ensures that data used for AI models remains private, as the zero-knowledge proofs validate the data without revealing any sensitive information.
- **Security**: The cryptographic nature of zk-SNARKs provides strong security guarantees, making it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with the data.
- **Trust**: AI models can be trained and deployed with confidence, knowing that the data is both valid and secure.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: This database helps AI applications meet data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, by preserving the privacy of sensitive data.

## Dependencies

- Rust programming language
- `bellman` library for zk-SNARKs
- `pairing` library for pairing-friendly elliptic curves
- `rand` library for random number generation
